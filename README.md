# Personal Scripts Repository

This repository contains a collection of scripts I've created for personal use. They were developed to automate tasks, explore ideas, or solve specific problems I encountered. While these scripts were primarily written for my own needs, I thought they might be useful to others as well.

## Contents

The repository may include scripts written in:

- **Python**: For data processing, automation, or small utilities.
- **PowerShell**: For Windows system tasks, automation, and administrative functions.

## Disclaimer

- These scripts are provided **as-is**, with **no guarantees** of functionality, performance, or security.
- **No support** is provided. Use at your own risk.
- Feel free to explore, adapt, or improve them as needed.

## License

Unless otherwise specified, these scripts are shared under the LICENSE, allowing you to use, modify, and distribute them freely.

Thanks for stopping by! If you find something useful, that's great â€” but please remember this is a personal project, not a maintained software package.
